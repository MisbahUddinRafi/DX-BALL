    DX BALL is a simple single player game. There are four built in levels and one customizable level in this game. The player has to break the bricks using the ball and has to control the ball using a bar. 
    Both mouse and keyboard can be used for controlling the bar. 
    After the match ends, the player can enter his/her name and the high score will be automatically stored. The player can also see the top three scores, and can also reset the high scores. 
    Background music is also added here. The player can turn on and off the music.
